# Itinerary Lite 📍

## About
This is my phase 5 full-stack project using a Rails backend and React frontend. 
With this app, a user can create a very simple itinerary for their upcoming trips. 
Trips are organized by category, and can be edited and deleted. 

## To Run:

`bundle install`
`npm install --prefix client`


- `rails s`: run the backend on http://localhost:3000
- `npm start --prefix client`: run the frontend on http://localhost:4000
